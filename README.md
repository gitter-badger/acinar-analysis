This repository contains all the analysis we had to do to be able to write the manuscript.

The figures are generated by [this Jupyter notebook](Acinar and alveolar number.ipynb), and have been copied to [the Authorea document](https://www.authorea.com/274247/47HwqAxume3L2xkLOsg_SQ).
There are some other files here, with raw data which was needed for the analysis.
