This repository contains all the analysis we had to do to be able to write the manuscript about the changes in the pulmonary acini.

The main calculations are done in [this Jupyter notebook](Analysis.ipynb).
This notebook also generates most of the figures (in Python it would be `figures[1:]`), which have been copied as PNG images to [the Authorea document](https://www.authorea.com/274247/47HwqAxume3L2xkLOsg_SQ) which we've edited collaboratively between all Co-Authors.
Since Figure 1 was a bit more complicated, we generated it from the raw data with [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/MicroscopyFigure.ipynb).

The other [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) and XLS sheets in this repository have been used for detail work in the manuscript or to quickly grasp what's in the raw data.
The [file https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/acinidavid.pzf](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/acinidavid.pzf) is a file which Tiziana used for a preliminary analyis of the data in [Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).
